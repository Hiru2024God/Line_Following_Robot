🚗 Line Following Robot – Fixed Path Navigation

This project is a simple Line Following Robot built to follow a fixed black line path on a white surface using infrared sensors and basic motor control. It's designed as an introductory robotics project, ideal for beginners learning about embedded systems, automation, and sensor-based navigation.

🔧 Key Features:-

    1. Follows a fixed black line using IR sensors
    2. Powered by a microcontroller (eg:-Arduino Nano)
    3. Suitable for educational and demonstration purposes

📁 How It Works:-

This robot demonstrates the fundamentals of sensor-based navigation without complex algorithms. When placed on a track, it continuously reads sensor values and adjusts motor direction to stay on the line. A perfect Mid-level project for those exploring robotics or embedded development.

🛠️ Components Used:-

    1. Arduino Nano Board
    2. IR Sensor
    3. L298N motor driver module
    4. Jumper wires
    5. [3.7V] 1000mA 18650 Li-ion Rechargeable Battery
    6. Glue gun
    7. Double sided tape
    8. Breadboard
    9. LM2596S 3-40V to 1.5-35V 4A DC to DC Adjustable Step-Down Buck Module
    10. Black Electrical Tape
